## 🚀 About Me
I am a novice full-stack developer from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 , and I'm hooked-on working with React and Node in TypeScript. I'm also passionate about open-source and web-technologies in general.

I've just finished my final year of an Undergraduate Degree Programme in Business Information Systems, and now looking forward to new opportunities.
